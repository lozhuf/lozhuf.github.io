Most importantly, I didn't want to have to think about it - it should just be a unique identifier for every build out of Xcode.</p><h2>A matter of time</h2><p>I investigated a number of possibilities and suggestions dotted around the internet, including manually updating the value, scripts for auto-incrementing the number, and using branch commit counts, but all seemed to have one or other flaw.</p><p>The solution I finally came to in the end seemed to solve all our needs, and I haven't seen it described elsewhere, so I hope it will be of use to others.</p><p>All you need is to run this short script as a Build Phase:</p><pre><code><span class="type">BUILD_NUMBER</span>=$(date -u <span class="string">"+%y%m%d%H%M"</span>)
<span class="type">INFO_PLIST</span>=<span class="string">"${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${INFOPLIST_PATH}"</span>
/usr/libexec/<span class="type">PlistBuddy</span> -c <span class="string">"Set :CFBundleVersion $BUILD_NUMBER" "$INFO_PLIST"</span>
</code></pre><p>This generates a CFBundleVersion of the form <code>201704190842</code>. This may at first glance look like a rather unwieldy build number, but actually encodes a lot of useful information; if you squint your eyes just right it makes a bit more sense: <code>2017-04-19 08:42</code>.</p><img src="/images/bttf_clock.gif" alt="Back to the Future"/><p>It is unique (for all builds built more than a minute apart), is ever increasing (if you avoid building around DST changes), and mostly human-readable (you can cross-reference the date with source control commits, and also builds in the Xcode Organizer).</p><h2>Possible pitfalls</h2><h3>Time Zones</h3><p>If you have a team in multiple timezones you might end up with collisions if the timezone isnt normalized.</p><p>The above code snippet uses the GMT timezone (via the <code>-u</code> flag), but unfortunately this makes it a bit more complicated to cross-reference exact hours/minutes from the build time for those outside GMT. Usually, though, you would only be comparing at a month/day granularity, so in practice this isn't such a problem.</p><h3>App Extensions</h3><p>As far as I understand it, extensions must have the same build version as the app that contains them. This is a more complicated nut to crack, but one that I believe is crackable (we dont currently have any extensions in our app, so we've avoided this problem so far).</p><hr><p>Despite these possible wrinkles we have been successfully using it in production for the last 3 years. Obviously every project/team is different, so your mileage may vary, but I hope you find this useful too.</p></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>. 100% JavaScript-free.</p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
